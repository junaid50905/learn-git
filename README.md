### There are many different version control systems available. For example, 

    Subversion
    Perforce
    AWS Code Commit
    Mercurial
    Git
### Version control systems can be split into two types or categories. 
    Centralized version control systems(CVCS)
    distributed version control systems(DVCS)

    There will be a central copy/server repository of the project somewhere programmers will 'commit' the changes to this central copy.
